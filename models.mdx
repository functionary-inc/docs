title: "Models"
---

A Model is the core representation of an object in Functionary. This is different for every company,
but usually is a customer and/or an organization. That said, you can name it however you like.

These models are declared in the configuration file under the model key. They are created by
calling the `/api/v1/identify` endpoint.

<Info>
  There is a special `onFunctionaryIdentify` event that is fired when you
  identify an model. If you need to take action on when identifying a model,
  create a step in a funnel with the event name on `onFunctionaryIdentify`.
