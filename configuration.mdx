### Models

A representation of an object that takes actions. This is be different for every company, but usually is a customer or organization. That said, you can name it however you like.

These models are declared in the configuration file. They are created by calling the `/api/v1/identify` endpoint.

```json Model Example
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "organization",
      "trigger_on_first_identify": {
        ..trigers
      },
    },
    { "name": "customer" },
  ]
  ..restOfConfig
}

```

### Actions

Actions represent an event or sequence of events that are taken by a model. These event sequences activate different triggers.

As models objects use the product,the developer call `/api/v1/events` which triggers
