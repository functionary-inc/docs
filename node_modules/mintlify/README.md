### üöÄ Installation

Download the Mintlify CLI using the following command

```
npm i mintlify -g
```

### üë©‚Äçüíª Development

Run the following command at the root of your Mintlify application to preview changes locally.

```
mintlify dev
```

Note - `mintlify dev` requires `yarn` and it's recommended you install it as a global installation. If you don't have yarn installed already run `npm install --global yarn` in your terminal.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Mintlify dev is updating really slowly - Run `mintlify clear` to clear the cache.
